.task[COMMENT:]  

A photon is a piece of energy that 
* has no mass
* moves at the speed of light
* acts like a particle
* has momentum
The energy of a photon is quantized.

* A photon is the smallest discrete amount or quantum of electromagnetic radiation. It is the basic unit of all light
* Photons are always in motion and, in a vacuum, travel at a constant speed...
    * ...to all observers of 2.998 x 108 m/s. This is commonly referred to as the speed of light, denoted by the letter c. 

The basic properties of photons are:

* They have zero mass and rest energy. They only exist as moving particles.
* They are elementary particles despite lacking rest mass.
* They have no electric charge.
* They are stable.
* They are spin-1 particles which makes them bosons.
* They carry energy and momentum which are dependent on the frequency.
* They can have interactions with other particles such as electrons, such as the Compton effect.
* They can be destroyed or created by many natural processes, for instance when radiation is absorbed or emitted.
* When in empty space, they travel at the speed of light.

https://www.zmescience.com/science/what-is-photon-definition-04322/

Photons can be 

* *absorbed*, 
* *reflected*, or 
* *transmitted*  
 
when they strike the surface of a material.

# Local Illumination

---

## Local Illumination


One approach to make light-surface interaction more handlebar, is to only consider
  
--
***local* interaction** between 

--
* defined lights, 

--
* a viewer, and 

--
* a surface point.

--

This powerful approximation is called ***local illumination*** and one of the oldest but still used techniques for shading.

???

Let's have a look at what local illumination exactly is.

---

## Local Illumination


.center[<img src="img/lighting_shading_01.png" alt="lighting_shading_01" style="width:90%;">]

???

We have a nicely defined 3d scene with a camera, light and sufficient information about the surface, such as its normal at the point to shade

---

## Local Illumination

???

... and ask our selfs how to compute the color value of a point on a surface (what p5 currently does for us)?

---

## Local Illumination

*Lighting* or *illumination* is used to describe the process by which the color and intensity of light *reaching a surface* is determined. 


.center[<img src="img/lighting_shading_03a.png" alt="lighting_shading_03" style="width:60%;">]


---

## Local Illumination

*Local Illumination* considers light only provided directly emitted from a light source, travelling in a straight path to the illuminated point.

.footnote[[[Autodesk]](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya-lt/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/MayaLT/files/BoL-Indirect-global-vs-direct-illumination-htm.html)]

---

## Local Illumination

*Shading* describes the methods used to determine the color and intensity of light *reaching the viewer* for each point on a surface. 

.center[<img src="img/lighting_shading_04a.png" alt="lighting_shading_04a" style="width:60%;">]

---

## Local Illumination

Hence, the final color (the light reaching the viewer) of a surface point depends on the properties of the light sources as well as the reflective characteristics of the surface itself.

* **L** points to the direction the light is coming from,

---
.header[Local Illumination]

## Multiple Lights

.center[<img src="img/lighting_shading_05.png" alt="lighting_shading_05" style="width:60%;">]

The color that we calculate for a point on a surface is the combination of contributions from ***all*** the light sources that illuminate the surface. 

--

Hence, we need to iterate over all lights and collect their values.

???

In most render engines, we can get the intensity and/or color of each light separately.

The contribution of each light adds up linearly. This means that the contribution of each light just needs to be **summed up**.

## Lighting


For the p5 example we work with (for the sake of simplicity):

* a constant color for the ambient light, and
* a direction vector and a constant color for each directional light.

--

> In a 3D context you usually just use the lights and customize the shading.

---
.header[Local Illumination]

## Insight 3

### Now we have numeric properties for the incoming light!

---
.header[Local Illumination]

## On a Side Note: Color

Also, for the p5 example, we are working with the RGB color system and the intensity of reflected light at a point on a surface is calculated for red, green, and blue wavelengths simultaneously.

--

Hence, whenever we talk about intensity or color, we mean a rgb-vector.

Be based on the microfacet surface model: this theory describes how at a microscopic level, all surfaces have a certain degree of roughness which will scatter light rays in a more or less chaotic way, depending on this roughness degree.

## Diffuse Reflection

???

.task[TASK:] Is what?

--

A diffuse surface is one which scatters the incident light on a point on the surface equally in random directions.

--

.center[<img src="img/reflection_diffuse.png" alt="reflection_diffuse" style="width:100%;">]

--

This is also called a *Lambertian* reflection, and the appearance of the Lambertian reflection does not depend on the position of the observer.

---
.header[Local Illumination]

## Specular Reflection

???

.task[TASK:] Is what?

--

For a *shiny* or *glossy* reflection there is a preferred angle of reflection, meaning more of the incident light is reflected in a certain angle than in other angles.

.header[Local Illumination]


## Full Specular Reflection

--

This is a *mirror reflection*.

## Diffuse Reflection - Light Direction

.center[<img src="img/lambert_01.png" alt="lambert_01" style="width:100%;">]

???

.task[TASK:] What do we see?

--

As the angle between the normal vector and the light direction increases, the surface area illuminated by the beam of light (which stays the same) increases...

???

.task[TASK:] What does this imply?

A beam of light having a cross-sectional area A illuminates the same area A on a surface only if the surface is perpendicular to the direction in which the light is traveling.

... and the intensity of the light per unit surface area **decreases**.

.header[Reflections | Computation]

## Lambert's Cosine Law

.center[<img src="img/coslaw_05.png" alt="coslaw_05" style="width:50%;">]

The value of \\({cosŒ∏}\\) is given by the dot product between the normal vector **N** and the unit direction to the light source **L**. 

\\({cosŒ∏}\\) = **L** ‚àô **N**

Geometrically, the dot product of the magnitudes of two vectors is the cosine of the angle between them.

A negative dot product means that the surface is facing away from the light source and should not be illuminated at all.

With n as a *shininess* exponent.

???

The expression (N ‚ãÖ L > 0) is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 otherwise. This prevents specular highlights from showing up at points on a surface that face away from the light source. 

---
.header[Reflections | Computation | Specular Reflection]

## Shininess Exponent

\\[{cos^{n}\alpha} = max(0, R \cdot V)^{n}\\]

The specular or shininess exponent $n$ controls the sharpness of the specular highlight.

.center[<img src="img/shininess_exponent.png" alt="shininess_exponent" style="width:100%;">]

--

* A small value of n produces a dull highlight that fades out over a relatively large distance

--
* A large value of n produces a sharp highlight that fades out quickly as the vectors V and R diverge.

# Shading Models

## Shading Models

What we just learned are the parts of one of the most famous and excessively used shading models, namely the ***Phong* shading model**.

--

The Phong model looks as follows:

\\( I_{Phong} = I_A + I_D + I_S \\)

--

.center[<img src="img/phong_01.png" alt="phong_01" style="width:100%;">]

---
.header[Shading Models]

## Phong Model

\\( I_{Phong} = I_A + I_D + I_S \\)

--

With the reflection components modelled as


\\(I_{Ambient} = k_a \\)

--

\\(I_{Diffuse} = k_d  max(N \cdot L, 0)\\)

--

\\(I_{Specular} = k_s max(R \cdot V, 0)^n\\)

---
.header[Shading Models]

## Phong Model

.center[<img src="img/phong_02.png" alt="phong_02" style="width:80%;">]


---
.header[Shading Models]

## Phong Model

We can now define how much of an incoming light intensity is reflected on a surface point for a certain view vector.

--

For an incoming light I


\\(I_{Phong} = k_a + k_d \cdot max(N \cdot L, 0) \cdot I_d  + k_s \cdot max(R \cdot V, 0)^n \cdot I_s \\)

This is also called a **BRDF**, or better in this case the **Phong BRDF**.
