## The Workshop

Materials & Shading is a complex topic, enough for a term...

---
## Materials & Shading

.left-even[
* Intro Materials and Shading
* Shading vs. Shader
* Local Illumination
* BRDFs
* Advanced Material Properties
* Physically-based Shading
]  

.right-even[
* Rendering
* Global Illumination
* Material Interfaces
* Real-time Implementations
* NPR Materials
* ...
]


???

Why am I saying this? To give a better overview of the topic field and if there is interest we can always do additional days and / projects.

---

## Workshop Topics

### Day 3

--
* Example: Implementation of a complex material



---

## Learning Objectives

--
* Understand what shading is

--
* Grasp core theoretical concepts of shading and lighting

--
* Understand material properties

--
* Be able to implement basic materials within Three.js

--
* Be able to go from there to explore advanced and creative material options

Looks simple enough, right? ðŸ˜Ž

???

* The goal is to re-implement the material available in Three.js
* And with that I want to demonstrate that commonly used concepts aren't that complicated
